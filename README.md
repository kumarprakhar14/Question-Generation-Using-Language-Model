# Question-Generation-Using-Language-Model

**Question Generation using Language Model**

**Introduction**

This script generates different types of questions from a given 3GPP document using a language model from Hugging Face. The types of questions include analytical, factual, and inferential.

**Requirements**

-   Python 3.6+
-   transformers library from Hugging Face

**Installation**

![](file:///C:/Users/kumar/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png)Install the necessary library using:

**Usage**

1.  **Load the Pre-trained Model**: The script initializes a question-generation pipeline using Hugging Face's transformers library.
2.  **Generate Questions**: Functions are defined to generate analytical, factual, and inferential questions based on the input text.
3.  **Print Questions**: The script prints the generated questions.

**Example Output**

**1. ****Analytical Questions:**

a. How does the 3rd Generation Partnership Project influence mobile telecommunications?',

b. 'How does the standards organizations influence mobile telecommunications?',

c. 'How does the radio, core network, and service architecture influence mobile telecommunications?

**2. ****Factual Questions:**

a. What does 3GPP stand for?',

b.  'What does 3GPP encompass?',

c.  'What areas does 3GPP standardization cover?

**3. ****Inferential Questions:**

a. Why is it important for 3GPP to encompass 3rd Generation Partnership Project?',

b. 'Why is it important for 3GPP to encompass standards organizations?',

c.  'Why is it important for 3GPP to encompass radio, core network, and service architecture?

### Conclusion

The generated questions successfully cover a spectrum of cognitive processes, from simple recall to complex analysis and inference. This comprehensive approach ensures a well-rounded understanding of the 3GPP document, catering to different levels of comprehension and encouraging deeper engagement with the material.

The analytical questions encourage critical thinking about the broader implications of 3GPP's work. Factual questions ensure that foundational knowledge is solid, while inferential questions stimulate higher-order thinking about the significance and potential impact of 3GPP's standardization efforts.

 This structured questioning approach is useful for both educational purposes and professional discussions, ensuring that all aspects of the document are thoroughly examined and understood.
